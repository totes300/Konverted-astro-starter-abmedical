# Documentation

This folder contains focused documentation for individual features and workflows.

## Start Here

Use this path if you are new to the repository:

1. Read [Deployment](./deployment.md): host-agnostic SSR (pages rendered on demand, embedded Studio, `/api/*`, and middleware on one server); the deploy target is the adapter in `astro.config.mjs`
2. Read [Sanity Setup Overview](./sanity/README.md)
3. Read [Contributor Workflow](./sanity/contributor-workflow.md)
4. Use the task index below to jump to your specific job

## Security and access

- **HTTP Basic Auth**: optional site-wide or per-URL gate: **`BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`** / **`BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`** in deployment env; **Settings** and per-entry toggles in Sanity. Run by **`src/middleware.ts`** through the gates in **`src/features/auth/gates.ts`**, which read the published toggles with `getSanityBasicAuthState()` (`src/features/auth/sanity-basic-auth-proxy.ts`), keyed on one canonical path per page. Details: [Basic Authentication](./features/basic-auth.md).
- **Security headers**: enforced frame protection (`X-Frame-Options`, `frame-ancestors`) and a Report-Only Content Security Policy built from every origin the site loads. Details: [Security headers](./features/security-headers.md).
- **Studio API routes**: callable only by a person signed in to the Studio with publish access, as Sanity confirms (each verdict is cached for a minute); the preview session that skips Basic Auth is a signed cookie. Details: [Studio API auth](./features/studio-api-auth.md).
- **Rate limits**: nothing in the code limits how often a route is called. Before launch, add the Vercel Firewall rules for the draft-mode handshake ([Draft Mode and Visual Editing](./sanity/draft-mode-and-visual-editing.md#rate-limit-the-handshake)), the Studio routes ([Studio API auth](./features/studio-api-auth.md#rate-limit)) and Basic Auth guesses ([Basic Authentication](./features/basic-auth.md#how-it-works)). The whole baseline, sizing included, is in the `security-audit` skill (Vercel baseline).
