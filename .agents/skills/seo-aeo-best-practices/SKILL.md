# SEO & AEO Best Practices

Principles for optimizing content for both traditional search engines (SEO) and AI-powered answer engines (AEO). Includes Google's EEAT guidelines and structured data implementation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Implementing metadata and Open Graph tags
- Creating sitemaps and robots.txt
- Adding JSON-LD structured data
- Optimizing content for featured snippets
- Preparing content for AI assistants (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- Evaluating content quality using EEAT principles

## Scope in this repository

- **sanity**: SEO fields, GROQ projections, and Studio copy for titles/descriptions; this skill defines **what** to aim for in search/AEO surfaces.
- **astro**: head/meta tags and layout defaults (`src/sanity/seo.ts`), JSON-LD in routes (builders in `src/features/site/seo/structured-data.ts`); pair when implementing metadata and markup.
- **docs-maintenance**: Update `docs/` when SEO behavior, env vars, or sitemap/robots routes change.
- **modern-web-guidance**: overlap on heading hierarchy and landmarks (its `accessibility` guide) for both SEO and a11y.

Also listed in the Skills index in root **`AGENTS.md`**.
