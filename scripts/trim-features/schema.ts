/**
 * What the schema declares, read from the extracted schema rather than from the code.

 * `sanity-schema.json` is the one artifact that states the content model outright: every document
 * type this project registers, by name. That makes it the right basis for "is this content
 * stranded?", because the question has an exact answer that needs no knowledge of where any file
 * lives — a `_type` with documents but no schema behind it cannot be rendered, queried by the app,
 * or opened in the Studio, whatever the tree around it looks like.
 *
 * The manifest cannot answer that question outside the project it was written for. This can answer
 * it anywhere, including in a project that renamed its types or moved its schema folder, and it
 * finds orphans of types nobody wrote a manifest entry for.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the caller reads the file and runs the queries.
