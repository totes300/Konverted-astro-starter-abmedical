/**
 * Removes a feature from this starter, in the code and in the dataset.
 *
 * The starter ships as a superset: every project that starts from it inherits a blog, legal pages, a
 * contact form and four page-builder sections whether or not it wants them. Taking one out by hand
 * means finding thirty-odd files across routes, schemas, registries, GROQ strings, sitemap tags and
 * docs, and it never includes the live content. This does all of it deterministically, or refuses to
 * start.
 *
 * It only removes. Nothing is added back, and nothing is rewired: a feature whose removal would mean
 * rewriting a route rather than unwiring a registry pulls in the feature it is welded to instead
 * (see `implies` in `features.ts`).
 *
 * Undo is `git checkout .`, which is why a dirty tree stops the run.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run trim
 *   npm run trim -- --dry-run
 *   npm run trim -- --feature blog --feature section:media
 *   npm run trim -- --feature blog --dataset
 *   npm run trim -- --feature blog --dataset trim-test --yes
 *   npm run trim -- --feature blog --dataset production --allow-live-target production --yes
